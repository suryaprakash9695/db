# WECARE - Next-Gen Diagnosis in Healthcare

## Overview
WECARE is an innovative healthcare diagnosis system that leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide advanced medical diagnosis and healthcare solutions. This project aims to revolutionize the healthcare industry by implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques for improved patient care and diagnosis accuracy.

## Problem Statement
Rural and Remote residents encounter barriers to healthcare that restrain their ability to get the medical services they need. The problem of handling and keeping a note and regular monitoring is serious in India. Also, it has been continuously observed in no. of surveys that the nurses and doctors in India suffer through burnout due to heavy workload and hectic schedule, which is a matter of concern. The records of patients are not well-maintained on either grounds and hence seems to be a greater problem in the picture.

## Why This Issue? üîí
India has a vital shortage of trained doctors universally when compared to the WHO recommended ratio. Additionally, with about 80 per cent of the medicinal workforce focused in the top 8-10 towns and treating only 28 per cent of the total residents, access to healthcare remains a hope for many. In rural India, a patient may have to travel to another city to meet a doctor.

## Objectives üìö
- Develop an AI-powered diagnostic system for accurate disease prediction
- Create a user-friendly interface for both healthcare providers and patients
- Implement real-time monitoring and analysis of patient health data
- Provide personalized treatment recommendations based on patient history
- Enable secure and efficient telemedicine consultations

We would market our system to the general public and aware the doctors and medical fraternity of the benefits of our product. Our product is helpful for all kinds of patients who aren't comfortable/able to visit the doctors/physicians physically. It is equally beneficial and convenient for the doctors as well.
